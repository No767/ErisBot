# ErisBot
This project was mostly motivated by a server requesting a specific functionality that other discord bots did not have so I decided to try and add it. 
The image generation was purely for practice and seemed like it might be fun.

This project was built using many libraries including PIL(Pillow), os, dotenv, requests, asyncio, datetime, and pytz. 
This bot uses the discord API to generate an output dependant on user input commands.

In this project I learned many libraries and learned to plan out projects before going straight into programming them and also learned about storing images in temporary memory.

This project will hopefully store all values in countdown persistently in an SQL database eventually. 

Features: 
-Countdown to events that users can make. 
-Image generation using avatars of the users mentioned in the user input command that were obtained using the discord API.
